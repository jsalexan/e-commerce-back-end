  ## Description
  This application is a back end for an e-commerce site. There is no front end, so we utilize Insomnia to demonstrate its function. It allows the user to get data, get by id, update, and delete, with ease. 
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: This application utilizes mySQL, NodeJS, Sequelize, Express, and Insomnia, along with JavaScript, JSON, and more..
  <br><br>
  Some of the challenges I faced in creating this app include getting the routes set up just right. It takes a lot to coordinate all the moving pieces and be sure it was working as intended. 
  <br><br>
  In the future, it would be fun to create the front end and see it work as a full stack application.
